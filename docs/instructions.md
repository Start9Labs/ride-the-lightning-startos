# Ride the Lightning (RTL)

## Dependencies

RTL requires Lightning Network Daemon (LND) or Core Lightning (CLN) to function. By default, RTL will connect to the chosen lightning node running on your StartOS server.

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to your RTL Tor Address (.onion URL) from any Tor-enabled browser.
1. Insert your password. You can find your password in `Properties`. Your password can be changed in `Config`. If you change the password through the RTL website, the change will be undone the next time you start the service.

RTL is best experienced on a desktop or laptop computer.

For more detailed instructions on how to use RTL and the Lightning Network, see the official RTL [documentation](https://github.com/Ride-The-Lightning/RTL).
