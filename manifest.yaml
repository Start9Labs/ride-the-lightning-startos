release-notes: |
  This is a maintenance release which mainly addresses application vulnerabilities and minor enhancements

  Vulnerabilities addressed with this release:
    - CSRF token based authentication, which strengthens the app against cross site attacks in the browser
    - Passwords like ‘password’, ‘changeme’ or ‘moneyprintergobrrr’ must be changed before doing any operation on the app
    - Angular version upgrade to 12, which will require node version to be at a minimum of 12

  Minor enhancements:
    - Routing fee limit cap removed on Loop Out
    - Routing Fee rate will also be displayed in %age for easier understanding
